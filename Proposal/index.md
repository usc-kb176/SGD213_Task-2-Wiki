# Project Overview
[//]: # (This section is an example structure for the proposal to your client.)

We have chosen the 2D/3D sidescroller platformer game. The player will be able to walk, run, jump and be damaged. Think Mario but with a little twist to it.

## Design
[//]: # (How will you meet the client's brief, their expectations, and their requirements.)

### Project Name
Road Runner's Escape

### Description
[//]: # (This is the elevator pitch, sell the idea)
The player takes control of the beloved 'Road Runner' as they race through a series of fast-paced levels. You must run, jump & avoid Coyote at all costs or risk being caught!

### Begin Date
21/04/2024
### End Date
31/05/2024

### Justification
Read the design justification [here](project_justification.md).

## Statement of Works
[//]: # (This section is about managing expectations; list out all of the qualities that will be in the final product)

### Requirements
[//]: # (What are the requirements of the finished project?)
* 2D/3D sidescroller platformer
* 2D sprites or 3D models
* Must be sidescrolling
* Objects must be reusable & be able to be put into any level and work
* Player needs to walk, run, jump and be damaged
* Pickups to be implemented

### Expectations
[//]: # (What are the client's expectations?)
* Project delivered on time
* Weekly updates on progress
* Client was to be able to put their own artistic spin on it
* Game is similar to old-school Mario games
* Does **not** require audio
* Does **not** require high quality art

### Assumptions
[//]: # (What are you assuming based on client responses)
* Game art can be placeholders since the client is wanting to add their own artistic spin onto it.
* Sidescrolling is very important so this will be a number one priority
